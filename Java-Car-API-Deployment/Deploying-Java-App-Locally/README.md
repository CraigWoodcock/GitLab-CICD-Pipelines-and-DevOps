## Deploying an App Locally.

In order to deploy an application locally, we need to first 'build' the application.
We can do this in 2 ways:

## Deploy using IntelliJ IDE

1. Open the project in IntelliJ.
2. Click on 'Gradle' on the right hand side of the screen.
3. Select 'Tasks' -> 'application' -> 'bootRun'
4. A 'Build' folder will be generated.
